## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs, questions and feature requests.

> :warning: Please **search the existing issues** before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  

For new issues, file your bug, question or feature request as a new Issue.

## Issue process

### categories

Issues will have a tag corresponding to their categories:
* `bug :lady_beetle:`
* `feature request :lab_coat:`

No tag indicates that the issue is a question.

### follow-up

To facilitate follow up issues will be assigned additional tags:

* `needs attention author :envelope:`: 

  When the author needs to pay attention to the issue (further feedback or question).
  
  This tag will automaticaly be set when the project team replies to an issue. 

  This can be skipped by adding `/info` to the project team reply. 

* `no recent activity :zzz:`: 

  The issue wasn't active for 7 days.

* `duplicate :boom:`:

  for issues where a duplicate has been found.

  The duplicate tag can be added by including `/duplicate #<issue id>` reply.

### house keeping

* Issues with `no-recent-activity` and `needs-attention-author` will be closed after 14 days.

* Duplicates will be closed after 7 days

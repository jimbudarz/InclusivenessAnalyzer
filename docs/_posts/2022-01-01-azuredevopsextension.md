## Task control options

Use the options below to configure exclusions and build state when non-inclusive terms are found in the repository.

**`buildStatusOnNonInclusiveTerm`**

Status of the build when non-inclusive terms are found.

Options:

* `warning` (Default) - Build completes with a warning state.
* `failed` -  Breaks the build if non-inclusive terms are found.
* `success` - Build completes successfully

<br/>**`excludeUnchangedFiles`**

If `true` (Default) limits the scan to files changed in the latest commit. If `false` a full scan is run on each commit.

The git checkout step needs to have at least 'with: fetch-depth: 2' configured.|

<br/>**`excludeFromScan`**

Comma separated list of file patterns to exclude from analysis. [Glob patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) are supported with a prefix of `**/`

Eg. `**/skipme.txt,**/donotscan/*`

<br/>**`excludeTerms`**

Comma separated list of non-inclusive terms to exclude from analysis.

Eg. `he,she`

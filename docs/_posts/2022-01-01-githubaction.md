The Inclusiveness Analyzer is a GitHub action that checks your repository for exclusive content, while suggesting more inclusive language you can use instead. This can be used for any repository on GitHub!

To install, follow the link. Select the latest version (beta testing has occurred!), and you can insert the code into your .yml file. Happy Coding!
